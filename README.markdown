Ludum Dare 24 entry: Conway's Revenge
===

My entry for Ludum Dare #24, with the theme of Evolution, is the game Conway's Revenge.

It is essentially [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) modified to work with multiple opposing teams of cellular automata. The rules of reproduction have been tweaked to make the game more interesting and 'game-like' by preventing deadlock scenarios and making sure it's not too hard to get your cells to grow and expand.

It has three game modes planned, two of which are implemented:

1. Campaign - A set of puzzle levels where you face off against progressively more difficult enemy formations (unimplemented).
2. Battle Royale - A bloody melee between four different teams of cellular automata. The grid is initialized with a random pattern, perfect for conflict!
3. Sandbox - A blank slate for you to explore and test your own creations with up to four different teams.

[Try it out](http://nickknowlson.com/projects/conways-revenge/) and let me know what you think!
